I'm currently a second year graduate student in the Department of Physics at University of Chicago. Previously, I was an undergraduate at MIT from 2015-2020 where I studied Physics and Philosophy. During my undergrad I worked with [Prof. Scott Hughes](http://web.mit.edu/sahughes/www/) on Gravitational Waves and with [Prof. Mingda Li](http://qm.mit.edu/) on applications of QFT to topological materials.  

My current scientific research interests include:
* Quantum Computing
* Field Theories in High Energy and Condensed Matter Physics

If you would like to like to collaborate or discuss any of these topics feel free to reach out via email !
