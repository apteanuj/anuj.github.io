I'm currently a fifth year graduate student in the Department of Physics at University of Chicago. Previously, I was an undergraduate at MIT from 2015-2020 where I studied Physics and Philosophy.  

My current scientific research interests include:
* Applications of Deep Learning to Physical Sciences
* Quantum Computing
* Field Theories in High Energy and Condensed Matter Physics
 

If you would like to like to collaborate or discuss any of these topics feel free to reach out via email !
