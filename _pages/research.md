Field Theories provide a unified description of disparate physical phenomenon ranging from Gravitation to the Boiling of Water. In particular, they are crucial to understanding topological materials that can be used to build quantum processors and storage devices. With help from my advisor [Prof. Clay Cordova](https://physics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/clay-cordova/) I hope to contribute to our understanding of these theories. 

You can find my publications (and all of the papers which cite them) [via this ADS search](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=AND&filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=author_facet_hier%3A%221%2FApte%2C%20A%2FApte%2C%20Anuj%22&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_author%7D&fq_author=(author_facet_hier%3A%221%2FApte%2C%20A%2FApte%2C%20Anuj%22)&p_=0&q=author%3A%22Apte%2C%20Anuj%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc). You will also find links to the arXiv versions of all of my papers via that search, or alternatively you can visit [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=Apte%2C+Anuj&searchtype=author&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=50). If you prefer, you can also usually find all of my papers at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=oX_oa18AAAAJ).
